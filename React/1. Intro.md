Jorwan Walke -> FaxJS
JSX (Javascript XML)

- Its just a library, a javascript library
- app's state changes, components "react" to this state change and get updated.
- If you don't have a lot of interactivity on your website, React is probably a waste of your time.
- React, in particular, mostly handles how to display UI and have it update when the data underlying the UI changes.

* React is a JavaScript library, not a framework.
* NextJs, is a framework that uses React.

* React is just a TOOL to give frontend devs an easier time. That is it! Imagine JS is an axe to help you chop a tree. React is a chainsaw.

- So, the idea is that your components can have a state, and when that state is updated, the component re-renders and you don't have to worry about manually telling the DOM that it's been updated. React handles that part.
* Typically, the first thing you do is create a small toolkit that takes a couple days to define code modularity, define data exchange patterns, a base component, and easier DOM manipulation.

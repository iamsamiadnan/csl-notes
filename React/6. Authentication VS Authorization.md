Authentication:
- to verify someone
- who are you?
- are you actually who you say you are?
- verifies the user's identity

there may be multiple factors of authentication. 
- two factors of authentication

Factors of authentication are basically factors that can be used to verify your identity. This factors can broadly be categorized into three categories:-

1. **Something the user knows:** credentials, security question, pin
2. **Something the user has:** Card, OTP on Phone, Google Authenticator
3. **Something the user is:** Biometrics(Fingerprint, Retina, Voice), Signature

**Note:** A not-so-common factor is _**Somewhere** the user is_ where the geolocation or IP Address is also used in the Authentication process.

Authentication:
1. Stateful
2. Stateless

Authorization:
- to have permission to do something
- what permissions do you have?
- are you allowed to do this?
- determine user permissions

Third-Parties (identity providers):
- they know a better approach to manage and maintain authentication system focusing on security
- to make our life easier
- oauth, firebase auth

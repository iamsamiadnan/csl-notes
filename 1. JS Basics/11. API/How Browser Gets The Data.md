When you visit a website, your device goes through several processes to retrieve and display the website on your screen. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Entering the URL
- **Input:** You type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), like `www.example.com`, into your browser's address bar.
- **Purpose:** This URL serves as a human-readable address for the website and typically contains the domain name that your browser will need to locate.

### Step 2: Browser Checks Cache
- **Cache Lookup:** Before contacting any external servers, your browser checks its cache to see if it has a recent version of the website’s files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.). 
  - **Cache:** Temporary storage that holds copies of web pages and assets to speed up loading times.
- **Decision:** If the website is cached and fresh (not expired), the browser loads it directly from the cache, and you skip the remaining steps.

### Step 3: DNS Resolution (Domain Name System)
- **DNS Request:** If there’s no cache hit, the browser initiates a DNS query to resolve the human-readable URL (like `www.example.com`) into an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - DNS is essentially the “phone book” of the internet, translating domain names to IP addresses so computers can locate each other on the network.
- **DNS Recursive Resolution:**
  1. **Browser’s DNS Cache:** The browser checks its own DNS cache.
  2. **Operating System's DNS Cache:** If the IP address isn’t in the browser’s cache, the operating system’s DNS cache is checked.
  3. **Router Cache:** If there’s no match, the request goes to the router, which may have a DNS cache.
  4. **ISP DNS Server:** If the router doesn’t have it, the request goes to your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) DNS server, which starts the recursive lookup.
  5. **Root Nameservers:** If the ISP’s DNS server doesn’t know, it contacts root nameservers that can help locate the authoritative DNS server for the domain.
  6. **Authoritative DNS Server:** Finally, the authoritative DNS server for `example.com` returns the IP address to your ISP’s DNS server.
  - The IP address is passed back down the chain to your browser, which then knows where to find the server.

### Step 4: TCP/IP Connection (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
- **Initiating Connection:** With the IP address in hand, the browser needs to establish a connection to the server hosting the website.
  - **TCP Handshake:** The browser and the server go through a three-way handshake:
    1. **SYN:** The browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate the connection.
    2. **SYN-ACK:** The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
    3. **ACK:** The browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet, establishing a reliable connection.
  - **HTTPS Encryption:** If the website uses HTTPS (secure), a TLS/SSL handshake occurs to encrypt the connection.

### Step 5: HTTP Request
- **Request Sent:** Now that the connection is open, the browser sends an HTTP (or HTTPS) request to the server.
  - **Request Type:** Usually, a `GET` request is sent to retrieve the homepage (`GET /`).
  - **Headers:** The browser includes headers with information like the browser type, cookies, language preferences, etc.
  - **Server Path:** The server uses the request path to locate the requested file.

### Step 6: Server Processes the Request
- **Server Response:** The server receives the request and processes it. 
  - If the request is for a static file (e.g., HTML or image), the server simply retrieves it from storage.
  - If the website has dynamic content (e.g., data retrieved from a database), the server runs backend code (e.g., PHP, Python) to generate the appropriate response.

### Step 7: Server Sends the Response
- **Data Sent Back:** The server responds to the browser with an HTTP response containing:
  - **Status Code:** Indicates success or failure (e.g., `200 OK` means success; `404 Not Found` means the requested page doesn’t exist).
  - **Headers:** Information about the content type, length, encoding, and caching rules.
  - **Body:** The main content of the response, typically an HTML file, which may include links to other resources (CSS, JavaScript, images).

### Step 8: Browser Renders the Page
- **HTML Parsing:** The browser parses the HTML from top to bottom to build the DOM (Document Object Model), a structured representation of the page.
- **Resource Requests:** As it parses, the browser encounters links to other resources (CSS, JavaScript files, images, fonts, etc.).
  - It sends additional requests to download these resources, sometimes even in parallel to improve loading speed.
- **CSS & JavaScript Parsing:** The browser interprets CSS to apply styles and JavaScript to handle interactive behavior.
- **Rendering:** The browser renders the content on your screen, applying styles, layout, and executing JavaScript as needed.

### Step 9: Additional JavaScript Execution
- **JavaScript Load Events:** After the initial render, JavaScript can trigger additional actions (such as animations, user interactions, or data fetching from an API).
  - For example, JavaScript may retrieve additional data asynchronously through AJAX or Fetch API calls.

### Step 10: Final Display and User Interaction
- **Page Displayed:** The page is now fully loaded, allowing you to interact with it.
- **Continuous Communication:** If the page uses dynamic content, it might continue communicating with the server using APIs, WebSockets, or periodic polling, allowing real-time updates.

This is the general flow, but there are variations based on specific website technologies, caching strategies, and browser optimizations.

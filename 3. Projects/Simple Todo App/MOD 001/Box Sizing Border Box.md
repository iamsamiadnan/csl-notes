The CSS property `box-sizing: border-box;` changes the way the width and height of elements are calculated. By default, elements in CSS use `box-sizing: content-box`, which calculates an elementâ€™s width and height based only on the content, excluding padding and borders. However, with `box-sizing: border-box`, the padding and border are included in the width and height calculation, making layouts easier to manage.
